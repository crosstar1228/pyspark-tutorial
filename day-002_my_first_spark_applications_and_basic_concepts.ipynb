    "\n",
    "Spark provides two sets of APIs, *Structured APIs* and *low-level APIs*. The Structured APIs are designed to implement the business logic of Spark applications and they hide the Spark internals of the *low-level API*. So for me, as a ETL developer, the Structured APIs are the best starting point to dive into data processing with Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "My today's challenge is to write my first little Spark application to get to get a first impression of the *Structured APIs* like *DataFrames*, *Datasets*, *SQL Tables/Views* and *Structured Streaming* and to undertsand some basic concepts like lazy evaluation of transformations, and data processing actions.\n",

    "## SparkSession\n",
    "Starting a Spark application generates a Spark job which is controlled and mangaged by exactly one *driver process* and several *executor processes* running across the cluster nodes doing the actual computational work. The driver process is controlled by a *SparkSession* object, which is the entry point of any Spark application, so there is always a one-to-one relationship between SparkSession and Spark application.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can I start a SparkSession?\n",
    "\n",
    "On day 1, I started an interactive Spark session by opening the pyspark console (*./bin/pyspark*). This implicitly creates a SparkSession which is referenced by a variable called *spark*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I don't want to type in all the code line by line into the interactive console, my Spark application must create it's own SparkSession. So every Spark application starts with something like this:"

    "Ok, back to topic. The main difference bewteen Spark and Pandas is, that Pandas dataframes reside on a single machine whereas Spark DataFrames are an abstraction of the in-memory optimized low-level API *Resilient Distributed Dataset* (RDD), which is designed to be split up data into partitions which can be spread across a cluster of potentially thousends of nodes. \n",
    "Spark DataFrames have a surprising characteristic, they are immutable once they are created. So how can data processing works when data structures are written in stone?\n",
    "## Lazy Evaluation, Transformations and Actions\n",
    "The few lines of my code already demonstrate that the Structured API has a functional design. Since dataframes are immutable, I have to use functions which reads dataframes as input, do some kind of data transformation and create a new dataframe which again can be the input of another function to do further transformations and generating another dataframe. So finally I can simply concatenate functions to create a sequence of transformations to get my desired data result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's do it. I want to see, if how it works. First, I want to read some data from csv file into a dataframe. The file has a header line and I want Spark to derive the schema, i.e. name and type of the columns, from the file. Nevertheless I could also specify a schema explicitly instead of deriving it from file. Determining the schema processing time, instead of load time, is an example of the common *schema-on-read* design of Big Data architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to keep in mind is, that the column types are not Python types (or Scala or Java types if I use another API languages). All language API commands are mapped to the Spark internal language *Catalyst* having its own types. That's why all API languages provide the same performance."

    "Running this code doesn't show any observable result to me. That looks strange on first view. Actually, Spark hasn't done anything yet, except for deriving the schema by reading a small sample of rows. This is because Spark applies *lazy evaluation* of *transformations*, i.e. no data is moved or processed until Spark is forced to by an *action*, e.g. by calling the *write()* function. \n",
    "\n",
    "By defining transformations, I just give Spark a set of rules describing how a given Dataframe should be logically transformed into a new Dataframe. By calling an action, I give Spark the command to apply these transformations, process the data and provide me the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for the lazy evaluation approach is, that Spark first wants to know the whole story about *what* should be done effectively before it tries to determine an efficient way *how* to do this. Therefore Spark first compiles all transformations into a **logical** directed acyclic graph (DAG), than analyses this DAG, applies optimizations (e.g. predicate push-down to datasources) whenever possible and splits up the optimized **physical** DAG into stages and parallelised tasks of RDD manipulations before starting to execute them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important to note is, that DataFrames are kept in memory when ever possible. In opposit to MapReduce, Spark tries to avoid writing intermediate results (i.e. DataFrames) to disk by *piplining* consecutive in-memory transformations, to gain better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This piplining is only possible for *narrow* transformations. These are transformations where each input partition contributes only to one output partition or where the transormation can be applied partion by partition, so the partitions can be processed locally on the same cluster node. Simple row-based filter rules or commutative operations like summing up values, are common examples of narrow transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in a *wide* transformation input partitions contribute to multiple output partitions, so data needs to be shuffled across cluster nodes. Sorting and average calculation are common wide transformations across multiple partitions. During shuffling Spark writes results to disk, so wide transformations are not performed in-memory.\n",
